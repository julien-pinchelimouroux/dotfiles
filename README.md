# dotfile

My personal dotfiles.

I recommend this emacs configuration to first year Epitech students.

Execute this command to install my emacs configuration:

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukapeschke/dotfiles/master/emacs/install.sh | bash`

If the colors seem weird, set the `TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color`
