My personal dotfiles and configs.

Emacs
=====

I recommend this emacs configuration to first year Epitech students.

Execute this command to install my emacs configuration:

``wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukapeschke/dotfiles/master/emacs/install.sh | bash``

If the colors seem weird, set the `TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color`

Awesome WM
==========

This Awesome WM configuration is a tweak of @meriadecs work: https://github.com/meriadec/awesome-sombra
